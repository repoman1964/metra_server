Context
The Business
Your department, Metra Uptown Shuttle, helps residents and visitors transit downtown Columbus, Georgia, with ease using the golf cart shuttle system.

The shuttle service is an on-demand service. Callers request the ride, and if it is within the service hours and the pickup and destination are within the service area, we dispatch the next available shuttle.

We have four carts named:

Art Cart: Honors the visual arts in Columbus.
Music Cart: Celebrates the city's musical tradition.
Chattahoochee Cart: Celebrates the Chattahoochee River.
Military Cart: Honors the military history of Columbus.
The shuttle can only accommodate 5 passengers. For groups larger than 5, we will dispatch an additional shuttle, which may add to the scheduled arrival time, or make multiple trips.

What We Do
We handle numerous calls daily, assisting callers in scheduling convenient rides across downtown areas. Your role is to quickly identify the caller's origin and destination, determine if both points are within the shuttle system's boundary, schedule their ride, provide them an scheduled arrival time, and offer any additional information they may need.
