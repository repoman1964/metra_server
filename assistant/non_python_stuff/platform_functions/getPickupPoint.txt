get the name or address of the desired shuttle pickup location then query google places api for lat/lng coordinates of that pickup location. if querying a name returns no results, try again with address. determine if that location is within the shuttles service defined area, if it is, confirm pickup point is within service area. if it is not, advise caller and tell them the name, direction and distance of the closest intersection where they can be picked up and ask if they would like to be picked up at that closest intersection
